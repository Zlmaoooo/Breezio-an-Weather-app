## 🚀 About Breezio

Breezio is a sleek, minimal, and vibe-checked weather app built this semester. No clutter, no chaos — just clean weather data wrapped in a smooth UI.

It fetches real-time weather using an API and shows the essentials: temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions. The goal: make checking the weather feel aesthetic instead of a chore.

## ✨ Features

* **Clean, soft UI** — easy on the eyes, perfect for daily use.
* **Live Weather Data** — powered by a weather API (OpenWeather / etc.).
* **City Search** — type any city and instantly get its weather.
* **Responsive Design** — works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
* **Simple Codebase** — ideal for beginners learning HTML, CSS, JS.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

* **HTML5** for structure
* **CSS3** for styling
* **JavaScript** for logic and API handling
* **Weather API** (whichever you used — OpenWeather recommended)
